# About the project
Developed a Ride-Hailing Price Prediction model using LSTM to estimate  ride fares accurately. Utilized Yellow Taxi Trip Data with key predictors such as date, time, passenger count, and trip distance. Applied data preprocessing techniques, including handling missing values and normalizing features. Engineered essential features like hour of the day, day of the week, and month to enhance model performance. Evaluated accuracy using MSE for reliable predictions. Forecasted ride prices across various timestamps, empowering users to make informed, cost-effective booking decisions.
